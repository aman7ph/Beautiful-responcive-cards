          <h3>Rock-Hewn Churches, Lalibela</h3>
          <p>
            The 11 medieval monolithic cave churches of this 13th-century 'New
            Jerusalem' are situated in a mountainous region in the heart of
            Ethiopia near a traditional village with circular-shaped dwellings.
            Lalibela is a high place of Ethiopian Christianity, still today a
            place of pilmigrage and devotion.

            Occupying prime position in the Axum skyline, the Obelisks of Axum
            have a history steeped in war, power, occupation and hope. Despite
            many years spent in relative disrepair, the Obelisks of Axum have
            returned to their former glory once again, and now dominate the
            centre of Axum.

          <p>
            In the 16th and 17th centuries, the fortress-city of Fasil Ghebbi
            was the residence of the Ethiopian emperor Fasilides and his
            successors. Surrounded by a 900-m-long wall, the city contains
            palaces, churches, monasteries and unique public and private
            buildings marked by Hindu and Arab influences, subsequently
            transformed by the Baroque style brought to Gondar by the Jesuit
            missionaries
